# Folk Canvas

## Explorations

- How do we make the web feel more alive and soft?
- How can we more easily connect web pages and their data?
- How easily can we turn a HTML document into a spatial canvas and visa versa?
- What would it look like if the browser had primitives for building spatial canvases?
- How can someone annotate, re-layout, and program web pages they did not make or distribute?
- How can we compose visual programming interfaces, hypermedia, and LLMs that work on any web page?

## Development

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

```bash
bun i
# then
bun dev
```

## Primitives

- `<folk-shape>`: Manipulate HTML elements in space.
- `<folk-ink>`: Draw lines of ink.
- `<folk-arrow>`: Define connection between HTML elements.
- `<folk-canvas>`: Control a camera (panning/zoom) and query elements in space
